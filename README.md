## Installation

You must have [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) installed on your computer, preferably the more recent versions. Type this into your commandline.

```
npm install -g anigrab
```

And you should be ready to get started using anigrab

## Usage

### Downloading

Downloading an anime is as simple as typing in the name of an anime which initiates a search for the anime. Ensure you have [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) installed which is what is used for downloading otherwise downloading will not work. For example:

```
anigrab beastars -e 10
```

This will make anigrab download episode 10 of Beastars from animekisa by default, to specify a site you can use the -s flag

```
anigrab beastars -e 10 -s gogoanime
```

This will download Beastars episode 10 from gogoanime. If you want to get a little more specific in the episodes of the anime you want you can do this:

```
anigrab beastars -e 1,5,10:12
```

This may look complicated at first but it basically means this will download episodes 1, 5, 10, 11 and 12 of the anime Beastars. Giving the direct link of the anime works as well:

```
anigrab "https://www18.gogoanime.io/category/black-clover-tv"
```

Will download Black Clover from gogoanime

### Usage as Library

anigrab has useful functions that try to intuitively fetch the information of an anime. Each file that handles a site contains three functions it exports which are search, getAnime and getQualities. Usage is as simple as

#### Search, Get Anime and Get Qualities

```javascript
const { search, getAnime, getQualities } = require('anigrab').sites.siteLoader(
    'animeout'
);

async function main() {
    const searchResults = await search('naruto'); // Initiates a search for Naruto, this is a promise so can be awaited
    const { url } = searchResults[0]; // Use destructuring to get url of search result at index 0
    const anime = await getAnime(url); // Retrieves the title of the anime and it's episodes, again this is awaitable
    const episodeURL = anime.episodes[0].url; // Episode objects contain their url, here we access the url of the episode at index 0 of the episode list
    const qualities = await getQualities(episodeURL); // This retrieves the available qualities of the episode as a map of qualities pointing to an object with the server that is host and the referer to use
    console.log(qualities);
}

main();
```
